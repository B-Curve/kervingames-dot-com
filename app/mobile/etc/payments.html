  <h1 style="width:90%;margin:5% auto;">Soon, this page will allow you to add timed payments like auto loans and
  online subscriptions (Xbox Live, Amazon, Netflix, etc). The purpose of this
  web app is to allow the user to track subscriptions that they have, so that they
  know exactly when money will be taken out of their accounts. This site organizes all
  of that rather than you having to check every time that you think your subscription might
  renew.</h1>
  <h1 style="width:90%;margin:10% auto;color:blue">Website is running on a NodeJS server that
  is based off of a Raspberry Pi that I own, which is being exposed to port 80 and
  I have this domain pointing to my home's IP Address.</h1>
